            "Let us remember that the automatic machine is the precise economic equivalent of slave labor. Any labor which competes with slave labor must accept the economic consequences of slave labor."
          </p>
          <p>
            "We have modified our environment so radically that we must now modify ourselves to exist in this new environment."
          </p>
          <p>
            "The world of the future will be an even more demanding struggle against the limitations of our intelligence, not a comfortable hammock in which we can lie down to be waited upon by our robot slaves."
          </p>
          <p>
            "There is one quality more important than know-how.... This is know-how by which we determine not only how to accomplish our purposes, but what our purposes are to be."
          </p>
          <p>
            "What sometimes enrages me and always disappoints and grieves me is the preference of great schools of learning for the derivative as opposed to the original, for the conventional and thin which can be duplicated in many copies rather than the new and powerful, and for arid correctness and limitation of scope and method rather than for universal newness and beauty, wherever it may be seen."
          </p>
          <p>
            "Just as entropy is a measure of disorganization, the information carried by a set of messages is a measure of organization. In fact, it is possible to interpret the information carried by a message as essentially the negative of its entropy, and the negative logarithm of its probability. That is, the more probable the message, the less information it gives. Cliches, for example, are less illuminating than great poems."
          </p>
          <p>
            "Our tissues change as we live: the food we eat and the air we breathe become flesh of our flesh and bone of our bone, and the momentary elements of our flesh and bone pass out of our body every day with our excreta. We are but whirlpools in a river of ever-flowing water. We are not stuff that abides, but patterns that perpetuate themselves"
          </p>
          <p>
            "There are no answers, only cross references"
          </p>
          <p>
            "Science is a way of life which can only flourish when men are free to have faith."
          </p>
          <p>
            "The most fruitful areas for the growth of the sciences were those which had been neglected as a no-man's land between the various established fields."
          </p>
          <p>
            "It is easy to make a simple machine which will run toward the light or run away from it, and if such machines also contain lights of their own, a number of them together will show complicated forms of social behavior..."
          </p>
          <p>
            "The simplest type of breakdown exhibits itself as an oscillation in a goal-seeking process which appears only when that process is actively invoked."
          </p>
          <p>
            "Progress imposes not only new possibilities for the future but new restrictions."
          </p>
          <p>
            "Until we in the community have made up our minds that what we really want is expiation, or removal, or reform, or or the discouragement of potential criminals, we shall get none of these, but only a confusion in which crime breeds more crime."
          </p>
          <p>
            "A painter like Picasso, who runs through many periods and phases, ends up by saying all those things which are on the tip of the tongue of the age to say, and finally sterilizes the originality of his contemporaries and juniors."
          </p>
          <p>
            "Scientific discovery consists in the interpretation for our own convenience of a system of existence which has been made with no eye to our convenience at all."
          </p>
          <p>
            "The nervous system and the automatic machine are fundamentally alike in that they are devices, which make decisions on the basis of decisions they made in the past."
          </p>
          <p>
            "The automatic machine, whatever we thinkof any feelings it may or may not have, is the precise economic equivalent of the slave."
          </p>
          <p>
            "Any useful logic must concern itself with Ideas with a fringe of vagueness and a Truth that is a matter of degree."
          </p>
          <p>
            "Progress imposes not only new possibilities for the future but new restrictions. It seems almost as if progress itself and our fight against the increase of entropy intrinsically must end in the downhill path from which we are trying to escape."
          </p>
          <p>

          </p>
          <p>
            "I have said that science is impossible without faith. ... Inductive logic, the logic of Bacon, is rather something on which we can act than something which we can prove, and to act on it is a supreme assertion of faith ... Science is a way of life which can only fluorish when men are free to have faith."
          </p>
          <p>
